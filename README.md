This is the sample project for the [UIAppearance for custom properties](http://corsarus.com/2015/uiappearance-for-custom-properties/) blog post.

This project shows how to declare custom UIView properties that can be set for all instances across the application using the UIAppearance proxy.


The code is written in Objective-C.
